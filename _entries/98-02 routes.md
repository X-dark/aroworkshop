### Routes

An OpenShift `Route` exposes a service at a host name, like www.example.com, so that external clients can reach it by name. When a `Route` object is created on OpenShift, it gets picked up by the built-in HAProxy load balancer in order to expose the requested service and make it externally available with the given configuration. You might be familiar with the Kubernetes `Ingress` object and might already be asking "what's the difference?". Red Hat created the concept of `Route` in order to fill this need and then contributed the design principles behind this to the community; which heavily influenced the `Ingress` design.  Though a `Route` does have some additional features as can be seen in the chart below.

> **NOTE:** DNS resolution for a host name is handled separately from routing; your administrator may have configured a cloud domain that will always correctly resolve to the router, or if using an unrelated host name you may need to modify its DNS records independently to resolve to the router.

Also of note is that an individual route can override some defaults by providing specific configuraitons in its annotations.
